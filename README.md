# My First Web Server!

The following are the files I used to create my first web server. I required the Sinatra Ruby gem in the server.rb file,
and then ran the server.rb file through the command line to create a local host. Subsequently, I used Heroku to deploy 
my website. To do this, I provided Heroku with information about gems required to run my code in a Gemfile, and I created a 
Procfile to specify how to run my program.
